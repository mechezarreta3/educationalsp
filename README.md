# `educationalsp`

A Language Server built for the education purpose of understanding **WHAT** LSP is and **HOW** it works.

It doesn't do anything specual for any particular language. It is focused on helping understand what tools like LSP **do**.

This LSP was tested with Neovim, but would likely work inside VS C*de.
